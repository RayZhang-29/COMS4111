3. Our sports club information retrieval system have completed our functions described in the proposal, below is the specifications:
We can query information for soccer clubs of three major soccer matches of England, the match includes Premier League, Challenge Cup and League Cup. We have all major clubs, and the coaches, players currently working for the clubs. In addition, we can check the awards that these teams have won in the past ten years. For example, clubs have their names, net value, and established year; Players have their names, age, value, and their position in their teams; coaches have their names, ages, countries that they come from. Provided with this information, one can easily know how the clubs are and the relationships between the clubs and those stars including players and managers, and how the good the teams are based on the awards they have won. 


4. Two interesting database operations
Enter an arbitrary age, or a age range, and you will see all the players of this age or age range, their net value and the team they are in, and their position in the team. Through such a query, we can roughly know what kind of state the players at this age are like.

We can determine which coaches have trained which players through the relationship between the coach and the club, as well as the relationship between the players and the club. For example, enter the name of a coach and then enter the name of a player to know if they have such a relationship. And we can also know the relationship between the average age of a team player and the age of the coach.
